# Privacy Policy for PhD Application Tracker

**Last Updated:** November 27, 2025

## Introduction

PhD Application Tracker ("we," "our," or "us") is a desktop application designed to help users manage their PhD applications. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information, specifically regarding your use of our Google Calendar integration.

## Data Collection and Use

### Google User Data
Our application integrates with the Google Calendar API to display your upcoming events alongside your application deadlines.

*   **What we access:** We request read-only access (`calendar.events.readonly`) to your Google Calendar events.
*   **How we use it:** We fetch your upcoming events to display them within the application's "Calendar" and "List" views. This helps you visualize your schedule and avoid conflicts with application deadlines.
*   **Data Storage:** All Google Calendar data is fetched in real-time and stored **locally** on your device's memory (RAM) while the application is running. We **do not** store your calendar data on any external servers or databases.
*   **Data Sharing:** We **do not** share, sell, or transfer your Google User Data to any third parties. The data remains strictly on your local device.

### Local Application Data
Information related to your PhD applications (universities, programs, deadlines, notes, etc.) is stored locally on your computer in a JSON file. This data is yours and is not transmitted to us.

## Data Security

Since our application is a local desktop app:
*   Your OAuth tokens (used to authenticate with Google) are stored securely on your local machine.
*   We do not maintain any central servers that hold your personal information.
*   You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own device.

## Limited Use Policy

Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
